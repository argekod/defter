### Welcome
**Defter**(means Notebook) is an open source software that is (hopefully) still being developed as time permits and as needed.

It can bu used for;
* To quickly take notes by double-clicking anywhere on the page
* To draw shapes, diagrams
* To collect data by dragging and dropping from the Internet
* To curate some data you collected about something.
* It is visual. It supports adding-embedding images, videos, (any) files to the document, and copy-paste, drag-and-drop text (supports HTML) from the browser (or from other software).
* You can make HTML-containing text objects clickable again by using the "Show as Web Page" feature in the menu that opens when you right-click on the object.
* If you double-click on an image that you have added to the scene, a text box will appear at the point you clicked on the image. You can take as many notes as you want on the image.

* You can export the scene as a PDF or HTML file.

This software is not an alternative to pen and paper. It is perhaps most useful for quickly gathering data from digital environments.

* It is licensed under GPLv3.

* Contains many Bugs and incomplete features. It is recommended that you do not use it for important work, (without trying it thoroughly.)

* You can follow the known bugs and features that are intended to be added (although not up-to-date at the moment) from the [Issues](https://github.com/erdincyz/defter/issues) section on this page.

### INSTALLING
It works on Python3 and needs PySide6 (>= 6.4) module.

You can download Python 3 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

If you have Python 3 already, you can install PySide6 with:
```
pip install -U PySide6

```
After you download or clone this repo,
cd in to "defter" directory 
and run defter.py with your python3 interpreter.
```
cd defter
python3 defter.py
```

Thanks.
